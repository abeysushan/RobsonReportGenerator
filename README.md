Epidata program to generate robson report
  
Robson Report Generator is an epidata based program to generate Robson reports in delivery points. Robson reports are essential to analyse caesarean rates in hospitals and understand the reasons behind caesarean section.
The data entry file can be opened with Epidata Entry client to capture data. Data will be saved in`.epx` format.
Data captured thus can be analysed and report generated by running the Robson Report Generator program in Epidata Analysis Classic.
